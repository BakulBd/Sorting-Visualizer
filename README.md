# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a React-based application that visualizes various sorting algorithms. It provides an interactive way to understand how these algorithms work by displaying real-time animations of the sorting process.

## Features

* **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** Visualizes algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
* **Interactive Animations:** Displays the sorting process with dynamic animations.
* **Speed Control:** Allows users to adjust the speed of the visualization.
* **Educational Tool:** Helps in understanding the logic and efficiency of different sorting algorithms.
* **Responsive Design:** Works well on various screen sizes and devices.
