      "answer": "Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Merge Sort work?",
      "answer": "Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the time complexity of Quick Sort?",
      "answer": "The average time complexity of Quick Sort is O(n log n), but in the worst case, it can be O(n^2)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you explain Selection Sort?",
      "answer": "Selection Sort repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and places it at the beginning."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of this project?",
      "answer": "This project is a Sorting Visualizer that helps users understand sorting algorithms through interactive visualizations."
